        <h3>Origins: </h3>

        <p class="lead story">
            My love for anime began at a young age, it started with my cousin. She introduced me to a show called Dragon Ball GT when I was bored and couped up at home. 
            It was unlike any cartoon Ive ever seen at the time, and I was hooked instantly. I loved it so much that I made sure I was done with my homework by 5pm,
            that was when it aired on TV every weekday, and I loved every minute of it. Then Dragon Ball GT ended and a new anime called Naruto took its place on the 5pm time slot. 
            I was quite skeptical at first, I mean, I ha dno idea what was going on, I was thrust into the middle of a story with no context, but I was intrigued.
            It didnt take long for me to fall in love with Naruto, and I was hooked on anime from that point on. The plot, action, and characters was something so unique.
            This genre as a whole is so amazing and unique, and it deserves a special place in my heart.

              Dragon Ball is just that Guy. It is THE anime. This anime needs no introduction, it is the most popular anime of all time, and for good reason.
              Goku is one of the most recognizable characters in the world, for both non anime fans and anime fans alike.
              The fights in this series, the story, comedy moments, and the characters are all so iconic. This anime shaped a lot of modern shounen and im glad it is the golden standard
              The anime follows the adventures of Goku, a Saiyan warrior, as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered.
              Sounds normal right? WRONG! This anime is anything but normal, it is a wild ride from start to finish.
              The fact that this series is still alive today is a testament to its greatness, and it is still going strong.
              From comics to games to merchandise, dragon ball is no longer just an anime, its legit just an entire movement.
              Nothing will ever beat it's popularity, and I dont think anything ever will come close.

              Naruto is the anime that got me into anime, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
              The story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja with dreams of becoming the strongest ninja and leader of his village, is one of the most iconic stories in anime history.
              The characters are all so unique and well written, and the story is so well paced and engaging (Lets not talk about the filler).
              The fights are some of the best in anime history, and the character development is top notch.
              This anime is a masterpiece, and it is one of the best animes of all time. 
              I'm a bit of an edge lord so I LOVE the villains in this series, they are all so well written and have such great backstories.
              And by great I mean absolutely tragic, no villain in this series is just evil for the sake of being evil, they all have a reason for what they do.
              Take Itachi Uchiha for example, he was a teenager who was forced to kill his entire clan to protect his village, and he did it all for the sake of his little brother Sasuke.
              This anime is a must watch for anyone getting into anime, its funny at times but amazing at others.

            <p class="story">
              Death Note is a psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
              The story follows Light Yagami, a high school student who discovers a mysterious notebook that allows him to kill anyone whose name he writes in it.
              That alone is just, WHAT!? Its insane, and so is the story, in a good way, well not really (No spoilers). 
              Lets just say the villain is the main character, and the hero is a detective trying to stop him.
              But the thing is, Light (The main character) doesnt see himself as a villain, he sees himself as an entity meant to carry out justice.
              Basiccally, God. Its quite interesting, knowing his reasoning, and his results that speak for him too, If I recall by then end of the show, 
              he brought down the global crime rate by 70%. That is insane, do you know how many lives would be saved by that, but at the end of the day, it just lies with your own moral reasoning.
              Thats what makes this show so compelling, give it a watch.

            <p class="story">
                My Hero Academia is a modern classic, and it is one of the best animes of the last decade (Depending on who you ask).
                The story follows Izuku Midoriya, boy born without superpowers in a world where they are the norm, as he trains to become a hero.
                The characters are all so unique and well written, and the story is so well paced and engaging. But wow, the villains, they are just on another level
                The fights are awesome and the story is so well written. The villains are some of the most interesting Ive ever seen, and Im saying that coming from Naruto.
                Each and every villain is one that was failed by society, leaving them no real choic ebut to be aht they are.

            <p class="story">
                Wow, where can I even begin with this anime. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece, and it is one of the best animes of all time.
                Now, how do I summarise without spoiling this masterpiece? The story follows Eren Yeager. In a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to giant humanoid creatures known as Titans,
                Humaniy now live within walls to protect themselves from the titans. Eren, hates the idea of being trapped in the walls and wants freedom (if you ask any AOT fan, that counts as a spoiler).
                The story, any compliment I give it would be doing an injustice to how amazing it truly is. Nothing is predicatble and oh boy, thinking baout the twists give sme chills.
                I am convinced this anime has one of if not the best written plot of all of fiction, yes, I said it, of all of fiction.
                If you are planning to watch this, dont even look anythign up, just prepare mentally for the ride you are about to go on.
