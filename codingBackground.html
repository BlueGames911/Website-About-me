                        Beleive it or not, my coding journey began in 8th grade, with a scolding from my dad for playing video games all the time. He then proceeded to tell me, "You know, instead of playing other people's games you could make your own". 
                        And I was like, "What!?", I can do that? So then began the journey lol. I went to youtube, Searched how to make a game, 
                        and by sheer fate, I stumbled upon a channel called <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys" target="_blank">Brackeys</a></b>.
                        I then picked up unity and started learning C# and Ive loved coding ever since. I learned how computers work, I learned about the origins of programming,
                        computers and how they evolved over time. This world, it facinates me so much, everything about it blows me away. Networking, grpahics, computer calculations, even AI,
                        even though I have base level knowledge of it, I still find it so interesting. From there, I learned C# and unity bit by bit (get it?).
                        I started with simple projects that of course I never finishedüòÖ, but I learned so much from them. Eveyrhting chnaged when I found out about CS50.

                        When I first started coding, it was for the simple prospect of making games, I've always loved games so it was fitting.
                        But when I began looking deeper, seeing all the things created with simple lines of code, I was amazed.
                        I begin experimenting pretty late into high school, trying to make windows apps, console based games, and of course 2D games.
                        C# was my favourite language at the time, so I tended to always go back to using unity a lot.
                        I Besides C#, I also learned some C++ and SDL2, which was a great experience.
                        I then found out about CS50, which opened my eyes to a whole new world of programming.
                        I could now put my knowledge to the test, and boy was it tested. I learned so much from CS50, from algorithms to data structures, and even web development.
                        I spent so long coding using C, that somehow, it became my favourite language.
                        I loved the simplicity of it, the way it made me think about memory management and low-level programming.
                        Even more so, it supported my love for game development, as I could use it to make games with SDL2.
                        C is a gem to me, that I will always cherish.
                        Thank you CS50, for showing me the beauty of programming‚ù§

                            C is my favourite language, it is the first language I learned that made me appreciate low-level programming.
                            It taught me about memory management, pointers, and how computers work at a low level.
                            I love how simple it is, yet so powerful. I can do so much with it, from making games to operating systems.
                            It is a language that will always have a special place in my heart. At first I didn't like it since I was coming from C#, 
                            but it really grew on me, it became my go to language, and now, I've chosen to ditch unity completely and make a game using C and SDL2 for my CS50 final project.
                            I'm having a great time with it, and I hope to continue using C for a long time.

                            C# is my second favourite language, it is the first language I learned and it will always have a special place in my heart.
                            It is a language that is easy to learn, yet so powerful. I love how it has so many libraries and frameworks that make development so much easier.
                            I used to use it for game development, but now I want to use it for web development and windows apps creation.
                            It is a language that I will always come back to, especially with so much Brackeys content to consume, it'll never get old to me.
                            Coming back to C# from unity was a bit weird honestly, but that made me like it more since it abstracted so many things I had to code by hand in C <b>(I'm looking at you "strings", or should I say char *)</b>.
                            I'll definitely continue using C# for a long time, especially with the new features being added to it.
                            Who knows, maybe I'll publish a game made with C# one day, like ConcernedApe did with Stardew Valley.

                            Java is a language I learned simply because of one tiny fact, Notch used it to create Minecraft.
                            I know I know, but wow, it's quite the versatile language.
                            I learned it not so long ago and I was surprised by how much it was so similar to C#.
                            I learned it for the sake of learning, and I have to say, it is a great language.
                            Honestly, I'd go as far as to say it is the better version of Python (Spoiler, you'll never see Python make an appearance on this list).
                            I wonder why it isn't taught in schools more, I'd say it's quite the great starting point.

                            I learned C++ after learning C#, and it was a bit of a shock to me. Back then I didn't know about pointers, or memory management or anything CS50 taught,
                            so I was definitely confused. I muscled through it though, and I learned a lot from it, though I still prefer C of course.
