          <p class="story">
            I was actually introduced to gaming by my uncle. I remember it like it was yesterday.
            My uncle and I were very close, we spent a lot of time together. When I was living with him for a while
            I found out he had a console which he and his wife played on often. The first game I saw him play (and the first he let me play) was
            <strong>Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</strong>, and I instantly fell in love with it, and gaming as a whole.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            My favourite series of games is Assassin's Creed, with Street Fighter being a close second.
            My uncle taught me how to play and I was instantly hooked, but when I had to go live with my parents again,
            they didnâ€™t have a console. <br>
            All this happened when I was 6 by the way â€” yes,
            <b>I was introduced to Assassin's Creed as a 6-year-old ðŸ˜…</b>

          <p class="story">
            Later, a friend introduced me to fighting games through <em>King of Fighters '98</em> on his phone.
            We battled often using its Bluetooth netcode, and my favourite character quickly became Rugal.

            Gaming has always been a huge part of my life. From epic adventures to competitive matches, I enjoy every moment spent with a controller or keyboard in hand.

              Fighting games are amazing. They seem so simple yet are so complex in nature. The mechanics you have to learn,
              neutral play, defense, attacking, even the combos, there's such a beautiful layer of complexity that lures me in to it.
              My favourite fighting game is Street Fighter III 3rd Strike, a gem of a fighting game, especially complimented by evo moment 37.

              RPGs will remain a staple of gaming. They always boast amazing story, insane worlds to uncover and explore, and my favourite, linear progression.
              The facet that I can dictate how my character grows in strength over time is amazing. That being said, my favourite RPG is a whole different breed.
              Dark Souls, the game I instantly fell in love with. There are 3 reasons I love this game; the overarching story is amazing; the world, all the bosses,
              NPCs and the level up system; and finally, my favourite part of it, <b>THE DIFFICULTY</b>.

              I never thought I would be one to like pokemon but it really grew on me. I discovered it when a friend on discord recommended it to me.
              The game he recommended was <a href="https://pokemonrevolution.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokemon Revolution Online</a>.
              So the first Pokemon game i've ever played was an online MMO.
              From there i learned the mechanics, the story, and just fell in love with it. I then started to play the DS games, starting with Pokemon White. Heart Gold has been my fave ever since.
              And this leads me into:

              I wish I could put this at number oneðŸ˜…. When I say I <b>LOVE</b> 2D Pixel games, its a massive understatement. I do not know why,
              but I just adore these games. They are so charming, nostalgic (Yes I know Im only 18) and so fun. Making a succesful 2D RPG is one of my biggest dreams.
              (Spoiler to my final Project). From Pokemon to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stardew Valley</a>
              to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/943140/Sparklite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SparkLite</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337520/Risk_of_Rain_Returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Risk Of Rain Returns</a>.
              These games are golden and hold special places in my heart, I guess Street Fighter III 3rd Strike can get a spot here too. If I were only play one type of game my whole life,
              I would pick 2D Pixel games.
